# Rigidbody-Fps-Character-Controller
Rigidbody based first person character controller for Unity.

Just a cool character controller I made that doesn't have that annoying camera jitter bug.

Didn't tweak air movement and stuff like that, cuz i only wanted to make a pretty basic script that fixes the bug stated above.
